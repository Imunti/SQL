/**
In this excercises I used tables found on https://bit.io/CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech
We have two tables named netflix_people and netflix_titles_info under CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech repo/database
On the first excerise I gave alias people to the table "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
and titles to the table "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" to make it easy to write whenever I wrire the table names.
I joined the above two table using their primary key show_id to get the show_id from table people, director from table people, title
from table titles and type from table titles

On the second excerise I wanted to find the director of the movie Bright Star.
The director column can be found on the CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people which I renamed as people and
title and type of the movie was found in the table titles. Therefore I used Left join on the two tables using their common column show_id to get the result

**/

SELECT
people.show_id,
people.director,
titles.title,
titles.type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id;

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
where titles.title = 'Bright Star'; 

/**
Here's another example of left join where I created two table called Celebs and Movie with few rows in each tables.
I used outer join to get all the data from the left table i.e table Celebs and the common row the right table, Movie table 
**/

name Text,
famous_for Text);

Create Table Movie(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name Text,
movie_yr Text);

INSERT INTO Celebs(id, name, famous_for)
Values(1, "Kim K", "Reality");

INSERT INTO Celebs(id, name, famous_for)
Values(2, "Todd Kresley", "Reality");

INSERT INTO Celebs(id, name, famous_for)
Values(3, "Safari", "Song");

INSERT INTO Movie(id, name, movie_yr)
Values(1, "Wakanda", "2021");

INSERT INTO Movie(id, name, movie_yr)
Values(2, "Avatar", "2002");

Select C.name C_name, C.famous_for, m.name Movie, m.movie_yr
from Celebs c
left join Movie m
on C.id=m.id

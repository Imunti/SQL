/**
In this excercises I used tables found on https://bit.io/CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech
We have two tables named netflix_people and netflix_titles_info under CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech repo/database
On the first excerise I gave alias people to the table "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
and titles to the table "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" to make it easy to write whenever I wrire the table names.
I joined the above two table using their primary key show_id to get the show_id from table people, director from table people, title
from table titles and type from table titles

On the second excerise I wanted to find the director of the movie Bright Star.
The director column can be found on the CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people which I renamed as people and
title and type of the movie was found in the table titles. Therefore I used Left join on the two tables using their common column show_id to get the result

**/

SELECT
people.show_id,
people.director,
titles.title,
titles.type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id;

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
where titles.title = 'Bright Star';
